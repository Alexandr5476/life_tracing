# LifeTracing implementation clarifications

Read this addendum together with the frozen product v0.16, domain v0.10, and database v0.6 specifications. The historical versioned documents remain unchanged.

## ActivitySnapshot StatisticsSeries foreign key

When non-null, `activity_snapshots.statistics_series_id` references `statistics_series.id` with `ON DELETE RESTRICT`. The column remains nullable for true one-off Sequence child snapshots without a per-Activity Statistics Series.

A non-null StatisticsSeries ID is durable statistical identity. It must not dangle while an executable snapshot retains it, including after the source Template is archived or hard-purged.

## Archived Category option cannot be a new-snapshot default

Archived Template Category options are excluded when a new ActivitySnapshot is created. A Template Category default must therefore be null or reference a currently active option of that same Field at semantic commit time.

Archiving the current default option in one semantic commit must also clear the default or select another active option. Snapshot creation rejects invalid Template input and never restores an archived option by copying it.
